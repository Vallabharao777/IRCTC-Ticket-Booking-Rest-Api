Project Name : IRCTC-Ticket-Booking-Rest-API

Description : It is a Rest-Api which is used to generate train ticket to the user by taking user details as input in the json format.

Procedure : To create IRCTC-TICKET-BOOKING-Rest-API i used below dependencies

spring-boot-starter-web,  
starter-devtools,
swagger-ui, 
swagger, 
lombok.

Web-stater dependency is used to develop Web applications asusal Distributed applications(Rest-API's). And Starter-devtools dependency is used to perform live reloading of our application i.e, re-start the server when we make changes in the code. Swagger dependency is used to generate documentation of our application and it will provide information of our Rest-Api like URL mappings, Input data format and output data format and method parameters and its return types etc. Swagger-ui dependency is used to provide UI(User Interface) to test our application in a easy manner. And lastly i used lombok dependency to generate setters and getters to the variable and also to generate constructors in this project.

This is a simple Rest-Api which takes basic user details as a json format and it returns the ticket information to the user.

Thankyou...
